# Just a little landing page
I've got some domain names that I should point to _something_, so I figured I'd put together a little landing page.

Nothing complicated here. Just a bit of [CSS parallax](https://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/).

Deliberately simple, only plain HTML and SCSS.

The code isn't particularly neat because I'm not working to a concrete end goal; the changes on this can be charitably called "organic". Might have a tidy up when I know what the final page layout will look like.
